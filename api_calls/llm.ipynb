    "Problem : I'm sure you, like me, are feeling the heat - literally! With World Health Organization declaring climate change as \"\"the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century\"\", we're in a race against time to move away from fossil fuels to more efficient, less polluting electrical power. But as we take bold leaps into a green future with electric cars and heating, we're confronted with a new puzzle - generating enough electrical power without using fossil fuels!  \n",
    "Solution :Imagine standing on a green hill, not a single towering, noisy windmill in sight, and yet, you're surrounded by wind power generation! Using existing, yet under-utilized technology, I propose a revolutionary approach to harness wind energy on a commercial scale, without those \"\"monstrously large and environmentally damaging windmills\"\". With my idea, we could start construction tomorrow and give our electrical grid the jolt it needs, creating a future where clean, quiet and efficient energy isn't a dream, but a reality we live in. This is not about every home being a power station, but about businesses driving a green revolution from the ground up!\n",
